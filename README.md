# Rust DLL Injector

Simple DLL injector made with rust using Windows API. This DLL injector is just a basic tool and only supports the `LoadLibrary` method, therefore, don't use this tool in any real situation.

## Usage

Compile using `cargo build` and run `dllinjector.exe`. For testing purposes inject the included DLL `testdll.dll`.
